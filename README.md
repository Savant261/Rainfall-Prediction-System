A simple rainfall prediction system powered by Random Forest Algorithm(Supervised Learning) which predicts rainfall in the area by 7 different features:
i) 'pressure'
ii) 'dewpoint'
iii) 'humidity'
iv) 'cloud'
v) 'sunshine'
vi) 'winddirection'
vii) 'windspeed'

Depending upon the above data features of the area, the model will give distinct prediction whether rainfall is likely to occur or no rainfall is to be expected.

Also, to make the model useful for users, it is hosted on a interactive Streamlit app where user can input the values of the features and then see the predictions for the given values.
Visualizations are also made for better understanding and more thorough overview of the probability of rainfall happening or not.
