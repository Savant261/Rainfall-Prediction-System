## 🎯 Features

  * **Accurate Predictions:** Utilizes a `[Your Model, e.g., Random Forest/XGBoost]` model trained on [Name of Dataset, e.g., "Weather Australia"] dataset.
  * **Interactive Dashboard:** A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit to input custom weather parameters and receive instant predictions.
  * **Data Visualization:** Includes charts and graphs to visualize historical weather patterns and data distributions.
  * **Scalable:** The data preprocessing pipeline and model are built to be easily retrained with new data.

-----

## 🔧 Tech Stack

This project is built with the following technologies:

  * **Python:** The core programming language.
  * **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
  * **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning modeling and data preprocessing.
  * **Streamlit:** To create and serve the interactive web dashboard.
  * **Joblib / Pickle:** For saving and loading the trained machine learning model (`.pkl` file).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):

    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
